        <section class="our-story">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Simply Green was born from a simple idea: making healthy eating both accessible and enjoyable. Founded in 2024 in the heart of the city, we started as a small smoothie bar with big dreams. Today, we've grown into a community hub for health-conscious individuals who don't want to compromise on taste.</p>
            <p>Our journey began when our founders, passionate about healthy living and environmental sustainability, noticed a gap in the market for truly healthy fast food options. They envisioned a place where busy professionals, families, and students could grab nutritious meals that are both delicious and environmentally responsible.</p>
