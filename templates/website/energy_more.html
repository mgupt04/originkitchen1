    <center><p class="paragraphmore">
In an effort to reduce our energy consumption and carbon footprint, all of our establishments are equipped with state-of-the-art, energy-efficient appliances and lighting. Our establishments are lit using LED bulbs that consume a fraction of the power of traditional lighting yet last many times longer. The same can be said for our kitchens, which operate on energy-star-rated appliances without compromising performance but using lesser electricity. Not only are these practices good for the environment, but they also help with operational efficiency in our quest to deliver a responsible quality experience.
