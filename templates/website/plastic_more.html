    <h1 class="moreTitle">Plastic Free</h1>


   <center> <p class="paragraphmore">
In this way, part of the commitment to minimizing environmental impact involves carrying out operations that avoid single-use plastics, in line with the replacement of conventional plastic items with biodegradable alternatives made from materials such as bamboo, cornstarch, and recycled paper for items like straws and utensils, take-out containers. We also encourage our customers to bring their containers and cups by offering discounts or other types of offers. In doing so, by phasing out plastics and embracing sustainable materials, we greatly reduce the possibility of waste to ensure a cleaner and healthier world.
