    <center><p class="paragraphmore">
This therefore brings about water being recognized and valued as the resource it really is. Initiatives in place include installing low-flow faucets and dishwashers, without trading out performance for water conservation. Secondly, we recycle water through a collection of grey water for reuse other than potable purposes, for example, irrigation and cleaning. Those combined surely reduce our water footprint and mean wise use every day.
